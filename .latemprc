# This is a config file for the program latemp.
# Comments (lines starting with #) and empty lines are ignored.
# You may change the default directory where .tex files are stored - DEFAULT = ~/Documents/latextemplates
# If using a non-terminal based editor, latemp will ignore the pdfViewer and assume that your editor has one built-in.
# Note that both editor and pdfViewer must be in your PATH or you may list the full path to the program binary.
